        "obligation1Desc" : "The character has a strong addiction he must keep feeding. Whether it’s a physical addiction stims, dust, or alcohol, or a mental addiction such as gambling, law-breaking, or priceless antiques, the character devotes a lot of time, energy, and resources to pursuing or obtaining the object of his addiction. Avoiding this Obligation has an almost immediate result—withdrawal. The exact nature depends on the addiction, but the character finds it increasingly difficult to concentrate on even mundane tasks, often reflected in the GM adding anywhere from 1 to 3 setback in skill checks",
        "obligation2" : "Betrayal",
        "obligation2Desc" : "This Obligation can work in one of two ways: either the character is the target of a deep and personal betrayal, or the character is the one who betrayed others. Whether it’s as simple as a betrayed confidence or broken promise or as serious as treason or mutiny, the betrayal eats away at the character and affects his everyday life. The target of the betrayal may seek answers, compensation, or simply revenge.",
        "obligation3" : "Blackmail",
        "obligation3Desc" : "Someone has discovered one of the PC’s dirty secrets and is using that knowledge for some sort of gain. To make matters worse, the blackmailer possesses evidence that could possibly leak out—a holovid, bank records, a weapon used during a crime, and so on. In order to keep the secret safe, the character must do what he is told, although the blackmailer is savvy enough to keep the demand simple, easy, or cheap enough to maintain the blackmail for as long as possible, generally money or favors.",
        "obligation4" : "Bounty",
        "obligation4Desc" : "For some reason, the character has a price on his head. This may be in the form of a legal warrant or a contract by criminals, collection agencies, or even someone who felt his honor violated in some way. What he did to earn this mark is up to his background, and the severity of his actions can be based on the size of his Obligation.",
        "obligation5" : "Criminal",
        "obligation5Desc" : "The character has a criminal record, or was accused of a crime (perhaps one he didn’t even commit), and is somehow embroiled in the legal system. Obligation may be settled by paying ongoing legal costs, making attempts to bury evidence, or efforts to prove his innocence.",
        "obligation6" : "Debt",
        "obligation6Desc" : "The character owes someone a great deal, whether that debt consists of money or something else. Perhaps the PC has a huge gambling debt to a Hutt, is indebted to the Czerka Corporation for his starship, owes a wealthy family for patronage, or has some other serious financial obligation. To make matters worse, depending on who owns the debt, even fully paying it off might not get the character completely off the hook—if the character can get that money, he can surely get more.",
        "obligation7" : "Dutybound",
        "obligation7Desc" : "The PC has a deep sense of duty that he feels compelled to fulfill, such as military service, making good on a contract, or following some sort of thieves’ code. Unlike the Oath Obligation (see below), a Dutybound character has some legal or ritualistic bind to an organization or cause making it extremely difficult or detrimental if he fails to live up to that commitment.",
        "obligation8" : "Family",
        "obligation8Desc" : "The character has deep ties with his family that require a great deal of time and attention. This could include the care and assistance of siblings or parents, the management of an inheritance, trust, or family business, or simply mediating between squabbling family members.",
        "obligation9" : "Favor",
        "obligation9Desc" : "The PC owes a big favor. Perhaps officials looked the other way when he smuggled in goods, or a friend got him out of prison. Regardless, the favors are stacking up, and soon he’s going to be asked to pay them back or return the favor. This favor may be called in a little at a time, prolonging the Obligation.",
        "obligation10" : "Oath",
        "obligation10Desc" : "The character has sworn some sort of oath that dictates his thoughts and actions, shaping his moral view of the world. This could be an oath to a deity, a way of living (such as the Jedi Code), or a willingness to sacrifice for the betterment of some group or cause. Whatever the case, the Oath should be both serious and make life difficult in some ways for the character. It is a personal and deep undertaking, possibly without a truly obtainable end goal in sight. Characters who do not live up to this oath face an internal and moral struggle.",
        "obligation11" : "Obsession",
        "obligation11Desc" : "The PC has some unhealthy obsession that tends to interfere in his life, whether with a celebrity, a region, a political movement, a cultural icon, or some other facet of society or life. He must pursue this, possibly to the detriment of his health, finances, or well being. A character with this Obligation tends to get along well with others that share his interest, but is looked at with pity, amusement, or even a bit of fear from others that don’t understand.",
        "obligation12" : "Responsibility",
        "obligation12Desc" : "A character with the Responsibility Obligation feels a strong sense of accountability or relationship to a person, place, or thing (a responsibility to kin falls under the Family Obligation described above).

This character, however. is a confirmed adrenaline junkie and chooses bounties not by their challenge or price, but by how exciting or dangerous they are. Avoiding the Obligation—perhaps by being a responsible business operator and considering every job's cost benefit analysis—results in an almost immediate case of excitement withdrawal. When inactive, the character is edgy, moody, easily distracted, and generally unpleasant to be around.",
        "obligation2" : "Vigilante",
        "obligation2Desc" : "The character has seen the wheels of justice grind up the innocent and let the guilty walk free. The character has sworn to take the law—for a version of it, at any rate—and bring justice to those who deserve it, When taking on contracts, this character tends to pursue the most hardened criminals.",

        "obligation3Desc" : "Some group or individual has dirt on the character, and is using it: to the greatest advantage possible. Perhaps she killed another hunter and claimed the bounty, or maybe she is operating in the Core Worlds without the required Imperial Peace-Keeping Certificate. Whatever the case may be, the blackmailer wields an inordinate amount of power over the character. However, this power is leveraged money, favors, services rendered the Character is subject to the blackmailer's moods and whims, lest the dirty secret become common knowledge",

        "obligation4Desc" : "A powerful and strict contract binds the character to a specific employer. This could be a crime boss, an imperial courtier or a wealthy corporate CEO.

All bounties are furnished by the contract holder and deviating from the terms of the contract can lead to a number of potentially harsh fines and punishments.",
        "obligation5" : "Rule Breaker",
        "obligation5Desc" : "Either the character very publicly and flagrantly broke one of the rules laid down in the bounty hunter's code, or everyone wrongly believes she did. Whatever the case, this breach of the rules of the code affects the character’s personal and professional life in a very real way. Contracts dry up, colleagues refuse to speak to or help the character, or the character is treated in a condescending or irritatingly sympathetic manner.",
        "obligation6" : "Debt",
        "obligation6Desc" : "The character owes quite a bit of money to one or more individuals. This could be money owed to a shipyard for some expensive modifications done to the character‘s ship on credit or funds put forth by a patron who backed the character's entry into the bounty hunters' guild and expects to be repaid or services rendered.",
        "obligation7" : "Betrayal",
        "obligation7Desc" : "In the course of the job, the character has either suffered some kind of deep personal betrayal at the hands of another bounty hunter, or is the perpetrator of such a betrayal. The betrayal affects the character's day to day life, whether through physical reminders, emotional scars, or some combination of the two. If the character was the betrayer, the victim may come looking or answers, compensation, or revenge at any moment.",
        "obligation8" : "Family",
        "obligation8Desc" : "This hunter’s family holds an incredible influence over the character. Perhaps the PC comes from a long line of bounty hunters, whose honor must be upheld. Alternately, the bounty hunter could also be supporting a struggling family and is always eager to pick up contracts to send money home.",
        "obligation9" : "Favor",
        "obligation9Desc" : "The Character owes a favor to someone in a position to power: However, this favor came about, whether personally or professionally, repayment of that favor is coming due with interest. This favor may be called in all at once, or a little at a time, prolonging the character's Obligation",
        "obligation10" : "Criminal",
        "obligation10Desc" : "The character has been accused of committing a crime during the collection of a legal bounty. This could be anything from stealing a speeder in order to chase a fleeing fugitive or interference with bonded law enforcement to killing innocents during a shootout. Whatever the case the constant threat of discovery and incarceration hovers over their character. Whether the accusations are true is irrelevant; the character has been accused and there is an outstanding warrant that makes the PC an appealing target to other bounty hunters.",
        "obligation11" : "Keeper of the Faith",
        "obligation11Desc" : "Much to many other freelancers' amusement, this character has sworn to faithfully uphold both the spirit and the letter of some code of honor. The PC believes very strongly in these edicts and adheres to them with an almost religious fervor, The Character never knowingly breaks any of the rules laid down in the code, and may turn on colleagues who do so.",
        "obligation12" : "Fame",
        "obligation12Desc" : "The character’s reputation casts a long shadow. Perhaps the PC took a famous and difficult bounty or owns a recognizable and deadly ship or has beaten another well-known hunter to the punch in the past. Whatever the case it is hard for the character to move unnoticed throughout the galaxy. This makes covert operations more difficult but also means that informants are more likely to spill what they know when the PC arrives."

The PC might owe the debt due from a time the crew saved the PC’s career or even life through hard work and sacrifice.",
        "obligation2" : "Contract",
        "obligation2Desc" : "The PC has a pressing contract to fulfill. whether it is legally binding or an informal deal. The contract maybe for providing, installing or repairing technical items or on call services. Fulfilling terms of the contract reduces the character's Obligation. while putting them off or incurring additional expenses for the sake of fulfilling, the contract might increase it.",

        "obligation3Desc" : "Someone has discovered one of the PCs dirty secrets through slicing or other technical means. The blackmailer has possession of evidence damaging to the PC's business, family or organization. The evidence is mostly stolen technical data. such as electronic 'records holovid recordings sensor data. maintenance records. secret computer codes. or similar tech-related items. To keep the secrets safe, the PC must keep the blackmailer happy, possibly through payments or granting favors. The blackmailer is cunning enough to maintain just enough of a threat to keep benefitting from the situation but not so much that the PC decides to allow the release of the evidence or to hunt down the blackmailer to permanently put an end to the danger the information poses.",
        "obligation4" : "Bounty",
        "obligation4Desc" : "The PC has an active bounty. earned during an attempt to expose the workings of a criminal or corrupt organization. The PC might have acquired evidence of the organizations misdeeds from databanks through slicing or other technical skulduggery and then attempted to take the information public. whether this meant presenting it to the authorities or broadcasting it via pirated HoloNet feed The character's background and specialization can both I provide additional ideas as to the reason for the bounty.",

        "obligation5Desc" : "The character has a criminal record or is accused or a crime (rightly or wronged]. most likely for using technology illegally or providing the means for another to do so. Though the PC is not currently in custody there are outstanding warrants for the PC's arrest. The PC might seek to settle this Obligation by paying ongoing legal costs or fines. burying evidence. or convincingly demonstrating innocence in the matter.",
        "obligation6" : "Debt",
        "obligation6Desc" : "The PC owes someone a great deal. whether in money, goods. or services. The character may owe this group or individual for loans used to pay for training. buy new equipment, or start a business. Paying off the debt may be difficult due to the sheer credits value in question, as a result of the constant accrual of interest that must be paid off, or because of both. the debt might even extend beyond financial obligation. especially if the PC also has a personal relationship with the lender",
        "obligation7" : "Failed Installation / Repair",
        "obligation7Desc" : "A botched modification, installation or repair job has publicly damaged the character’s reputation and rendered the device, droid or vehicle inoperable. The PC must take action to restore the damaged item and then find a way to socially engineer a return to good standing in the public eye.",
        "obligation8" : "Family",
        "obligation8Desc" : "The character's family demands great deal of time and attention. not just emotionally but also in some technical capacity. the PC might be the only member of the family able to take care or vital machinery that sustains the family’s livelihood, food, water, or even air supply. if they live on a space station or in a hostile planetary environment. Though performing routine maintenance can help keep this Obligation in check, the PC must seek to engineer a long-term solution-one that does not require constant personal intervention-to remove this Obligation completely",
        "obligation9" : "Favor",
        "obligation9Desc" : "The character owes someone a big favor. Perhaps a government agent looked tile other way other catching the character slicing corporate computers. Perhaps a fellow Technician faked a malfunction or loss of data to cover for a failure on the PC's part. The magnitude of the favor is connected to the amount of Obligation. The Obligation could take an extended amount of time to clear. as it might be reduced by many small actions.",
        "obligation10" : "Unfinished Business",
        "obligation10Desc" : "The PC is working on a long-term project such as a complex computer program or a light freighter refit. It may be personal or commissioned work. While long breaks may be acceptable. the Obligation cannot be totally fulfilled until the unfinished business is complete, and it weighs heavily on the PC's mind whenever the character chooses to postpone working on it for any reason",
        "obligation11" : "Obsession",
        "obligation11Desc" : "The PC has an unhealthy obsession with technology droids or computers that constantly interferes with efforts to live a normal life. Whether it is repairing a prized droid, designing the next great piece of cybernetic technology or inventing a devices that defines the era the character has continual need to pursue this interest. Accomplishing significant tasks to further this goal helps reduce the character’s obligation.",

        "obligation1Desc" : "This is a twist on the standard bounty Obligation. Somewhere in the galaxy is a target that the Hired Gun failed to kill, and he is still out there, victimizing the innocent or bragging about his survival. The character must deal with this being, whether because the escaped target may be a danger to him, or that he feels obligated to bring in the one that got away.",
        "obligation2" : "Dutybound",
        "obligation2Desc" : "The Hired Gun was once saved from certain death, or an unfulfilled contract, by someone he would never have expected to aid him. He knows that debt is due someday and he's going to have to save someone in turn. This focuses the Dutybound Obligation on the Hired Gun's stock-in-trade: fighting and killing.",
        "obligation3" : "Responsibility",
        "obligation3Desc" : "Some say (with good reason) that Hired Guns should not make friends. A personal relation of the character is another Hired Gun or similar career, and not a very good one. The character helped him once, and he is out there in the wider galaxy fumbling around, causing trouble for himself and others. Because of that one act of kindness, he might call upon the character to help him at any time.",
        "obligation4" : "Favor",
        "obligation4Desc" : "Favors are often an obligation in a Hired Gun's past. Many start their careers with either a mentor or a sponsor, and owe that person for their support. In the case of the mentor, the Hired Gun might be more than willing to repay past support with a favor now that he's made it in the galaxy. Other sponsors, however, might have been less altruistic about supporting the Hired Gun's career. The favors they call in could be something the Hired Gun finds unsavory or even morally wrong.",
        "obligation5" : "Family",
        "obligation5Desc" : "The character has struggled out of the slime pits at the very bottom of galactic society with an almost pathological frenzy to escape everything from his past. And yet, some residual family obligation still remains. Maybe it is a younger brother or sister, or maybe a parent or close friend, but someone still cares for the Hired Gun, and he still cares for that person, no matter how much he wishes he did not. If some enemy or creditor were to discover these ties, they could easily be used against the character, and fear of this is a constant worry.",
        "obligation6" : "Adrenaline Rush",
        "obligation6Desc" : "The character is addicted to the rush of adrenaline he gets from battle. It was this character flaw that cost him his position at the upper levels of society. Now he must feed the addiction or the results turn ugly indeed. The character cannot back down from a fight of any kind, and often goes in search of conflict when things get too tame for his tastes. Should the character go an entire session without combat of some kind, the GM may add a penalty of setback to any skill checks in the next session (or until the character gets a chance to fight).",
        "obligation7" : "Debt",
        "obligation7Desc" : "Maintaining equipment, staying current with technology, and keeping weapons charged or fully loaded is not easy. Without these things, the Hired Gun has no hope of employment. The character found himself grounded without sufficient funds to prepare for a job and had to borrow money from an underworld figure. That outstanding debt now chases him from job to job. As the PC is unable to pay in credits, the debtor demands services as payment, often at the most inopportune times. The Hired Gun can reduce this Obligation by performing services for his debtor, but at the GM's discretion can also increase his Obligation for money (never more than once per session, and for a few thousand credits per point of Obligation increase).",
        "obligation8" : "Collateral Accountability",
        "obligation8Desc" : "In the pursuit of a past contract, the character was careless. He accidentally destroyed the prized possession of some major underground figure or killed someone important to that person. Now the figure holds it over the character's head. Ambiguous threats and demands for repayment have become near-constants in this character's life, as the underground figure refuses to let him forget his responsibility. He has a financial blood price or other compensation he could pay, but it is astronomical. Until it is paid off, however, the guilt and fear are ever-present. If this Obligation is triggered, the character can suffer setback to some or all skill checks during the session (at the GM's discretion) due to this burden on his nerves.",
        "obligation9" : "A Score To Settle",
        "obligation9Desc" : "The character has always been rough-and-tumble, but somewhere along the way someone wronged him, and he never forgets a debt, real or imagined. This could be as simple as someone promising him backup who then disappeared or someone bad-mouthing him in front of a prospective client. Now, the character is always looking for ways to even the score.",
        "obligation10" : "Betrayal",
        "obligation10Desc" : "The character comes from a culture where military service is seen as a righteous calling, and is only pursued for noble ends. The people who trained him do not look fondly upon his mercenary career path. Efforts to correct this might range from representatives trying to convince him to stop to assassins sent to end his sullying their name once and for all. Here, the Hired Gun has committed the perceived betrayal, and since his career choice is what's at stake, squaring this Obligation can prove very tricky.",
        "obligation11" : "Oath",
        "obligation11Desc" : "The oath a Hired Gun makes is likely something to do with a mission he must complete or his own code of honor. He might have sworn to finish some violent and incredibly risky undertaking, or he could have promised to uphold a set of rules of conduct in warfare that are hard to follow.",
        "obligation12" : "A Price of a Name",
        "obligation12Desc" : "The character claimed to be someone else, taking credit for his accomplishments in a past negotiation in the hopes of a higher payday. The wronged party, either the person impersonated or the hiring party, is now angry.

This doesn’t always lead to Bounty, however, since not everyone can afford the credits required for an official bounty. In these cases, the Smuggler just lives with the knowledge that certain parties in the galaxy would make his life very difficult if given the chance.",

        "obligation2Desc" : "Whether deserved or not, some Smugglers find themselves with a reputation for being untrustworthy or difficult to deal with. This can make finding jobs a struggle. Since the best way to reduce this Obligation is to successfully complete contracts, proving himself reliable again, the Smuggler might find himself having to take the least desirable jobs for a while.

If it was the Smuggler who let a fellow criminal down, then he must make amends somehow. In minor cases, a simple apology may be all that’s needed. In extreme cases, the betrayed party might need rescuing from the spice mines of Kessel or somewhere equally unpleasant.",
        "obligation4" : "Bounty",
        "obligation4Desc" : "Many Smugglers earn a bounty on their heads at some point. The size of the bounty depends on the size of the Obligation, as does the nature of the bounty.

This Obligation may involve avoiding a particular system where the character has a criminal record or hiding his involvement in a crime big enough to interest the authorities. In the event that the criminal record is undeserved, the Smuggler might work to expose the real perpetrator.",

Perhaps they live on a planet that rarely receives the basic necessities through legitimate trade, and so they rely on the Smuggler to bring them important but inexpensive cargo. Or perhaps the Smuggler himself has brought them misfortune, and a local crime lord holds them ransom to ensure the Smuggler’s good behavior.

Favors are a much-used currency among Smugglers, and the character may well owe favors to more than one party, perhaps even parties in competition with each other. The nature of the favor determines how to resolve it, and this is up to the player and GM to decide. Depending on to whom the Smuggler owes the favor, the player may need to deal with this Obligation sooner rather than later.",

        "obligation9Desc" : "if a Smuggler has the Notoriety Obligation, then he will be unable to travel incognito, as his face or name may be recognized This makes any jobs he takes on harder, if not impossible, to complete. This Obligation is only likely to apply in certain sectors, and the extent of its influence determines the size of the Obligation. The Smuggler's own behavior might have caused this, or another party may have maliciously spread information about him. If the latter, the Obligation could be reduced by tracking down the person responsible and stopping him. if the former, the Smuggler may have to avoid the affected area long enough that the locals forget him, or he might significantly change his appearance or name to avoid recognition.",
