                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>Obligation represents the debt a PC owes. These debts can be physical(Money owed, Services that must
                    be repaid or a binding contract) or they could be intangible(a feeling of responsibility to a
                    friend’s well-being, the duty he feels to help his family or a favor owed to somebody).</p>
            </div>
            <div id="header-paragraph-2">
                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>Depending on the GM the player should either pick their own obligation based off the thought of their
                    character background or should roll a d-100 and make one based off that. Other times a GM may decide
                    to pick one for the PC’s. Also, the GM typically decides the degree of the PC’s Obligation typically
                    5-25. This represents how pressing their obligation is for instance a 25 could mean a Hutt places a
                    bounty on you and you end up frozen in carbonite.</p>

                <h3>Consequence</h3>
                <p>Generally speaking, this will affect gameplay as much as the player gets involved and develops the
                    character. A player should make decisions for their character so they can fulfill this obligation. A
                    player can obtain new and pay off various obligation throughout gameplay but if a group of PC’s
                    obtain too much Obligation this will affect gameplay as their obligation can affect current
                    missions.</p>
