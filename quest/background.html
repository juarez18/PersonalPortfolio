                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>The background and concept of a character have no real mechanical effect but are rather a guide to help you make decisions for your character. These also help make decisions based on choosing your career, specialization, species and obligation. When it comes to making tough decisions in your adventure on whether to stare or kill an enemy maybe you lean back on how they grew up.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="header-paragraph-2">
                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>If you have an idea in mind already, try adding different pieces of information by answering some of the questions listed below. The process generally goes from general to specific so try to create a theme and fill it in or try the opposite fixate on a single thing and build the characters experience around it.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="header-paragraph-3">
                <h3>Consequence</h3>
                <p>The background of the character mostly affects the player’s decision making when they get into the mindset of the character. If the character came from nobility, they might struggle in survival situations. If they were a lone wolf their whole life they may struggle with teamwork.</p>

                <h2>FAMILY LIFE</h2>
                <h4>Parenting Style</h4>
                <p>Consider how the character grew up in the home. Was the father a tyrant, was there a strong connection with the mother that can exploited, or is there some relation with ancestor that could be important to the character?</p>
                <h4>Sibling Relations</h4>
                <p>Figure out what the family life of the character is. Is there an estranged brother or a twin sister that hasn’t been lucky at the pod racing books? Is the character an only child, or does the species create a whole litter of children?</p>
            </div>
            <div id="aspirations">
                <h2>ASPIRATIONS</h2>
                <h4>Dream Job</h4>
                <p>Think about the character’s most grand dreams, to discover the galaxy, to open a flower shop, a higher calling to help others that cant help themselves or have masses kneel in respect of their greatness.</p>
                <h4>Idols</h4>
                <p>Who does this person look to in the galaxy and wish they were? Did they once meet Han Solo and are drawing up their own plans to make the kessel run in a shorter path, they’ve heard of Boba Fett and want to become the greatest bounty hunter the galaxy has ever seen, or want to join the Imperial Navy and join the galaxy’s best pilots.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="occupation">
                <h2>OCCUPATION</h2>
                <h4>Work History</h4>
                <p>Describe how the character made a living, whether it was a job they loved or hated, maybe a boss they engaged with that was a mentor or they worked closely with a Hutt crime syndicate.</p>
                <h4>Hobbies / Side Gigs</h4>
                <p>Then how does the character spend free time? Do they spend time gambling or baking a new recipe, playing at a Dejark table or crafting new gear? Also mark down other things the character might do for money, like steal casually, or sell something at a market to make money.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="finances">
                <h2>FINANCES</h2>
                <h4>Money</h4>
                <p>Determine the character’s relationship with money, is there a lot money in the family, where did it come from? Is money no object tot eh character or is it the only means they can eat? Is the character obsessed with riches and glamor or would soon kill you out of pride?</p>
                <h4>Community</h4>
                <p>Understand the character’s role in the community. Are they supportive of others or in a tribe, clan, gang etc.  that supports each other or are they a solo act that fends for themselves. Is there a select type of people they defend or just a sibling or close friend.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="time">
                <h2>TIME PERIOD</h2>
                <h4>ABY or BBY</h4>
                <p>The Star Wars timeline is measure by years after or before the Battle of Yavin (ABY or BBY). Typical this is decided  by the GM and can have an effect like where were you when Alderaan got erased.</p>
                <h4>Events in Time</h4>
                <p>Do some research into the history of the species what planet they are from, and what sorts of events were going on.  For example, are they currently in a civil war going on, a famine or other calamity? What about traditions or rites of passages that they might have failed or passed to gain honor on their home world.</p>
