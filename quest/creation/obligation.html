            <h3>Determine Character Concept and Background</h3>
            <p>When starting it is a good idea to think about what kind of player he would like to play and what kind of background they want for their character. You can think about things like how this character grew up and what made them into what they are today: Maybe they have had a rough life and are trying to escape into a better life, maybe they were bored with the middle class life and seek to the stars or they were living the good life and something caused them to fall from grace. These will help you understand your character and react the way they should out on the outer rim and why they are living life out on the rim.</p>
            <h3>Obligation</h3>
            <p>Obligation represents debts that a PC owns. Whether it is physical: Money owed, services to be repaid, or a binding contract, or intangible: a feeling of responsibility to a friend, duty to family or a favor you owe to someone else. Each PC starts with at least 1 obligation and they can lose this or even acquire more as the game progresses.</p>
            <p>PC’s may either roll and craft their obligation based around that or may choose one that fits their character. The size of the obligation is based on starting PCs 2 – 20, 3 – 15, 4/5 – 10, 6+ - 5. Be careful as too much obligation can have affects on entire arches as they deal with these issues form these if the parties get too much. For instance, Han Solo being frozen in carbonite by Jabba.</p>
